Project: HTML 5 Chat Client

Description: 

	Chat Client using the latest HTML 5 web sockets and file reader.
	This is an experimental project and the server is not completed
	yet. I am currently using an echo server I found online for now.

Protocol:

	When a client receives a message from the server,
    it will appear as a FROM message, but with either
    BROADCAST or PRIVATE prepended (indicating the type
    of message it is), as in:

      BROADCAST FROM ladygaga\n
      9\n
      You suck!

      PRIVATE FROM selenagomez\n
      15\n
      leave me alone!
